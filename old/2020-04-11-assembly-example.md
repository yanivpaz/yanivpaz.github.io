# Assembly timer example 
So after several years which I didnt write assembly code , I have tried to write timer simulation .
Here are the steps :

1. Install  GUI Turbo Assembler  
2. Create new file and paste [timer.asm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yanivpaz/code-examples/master/assembly/timer-example/timer.asm) code
3. Click F9 - Assemble,build and run

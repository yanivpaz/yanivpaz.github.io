# curated list of eks addons 
so you managed to install EKS control plane and worked nodes using [your favourite method](https://github.com/yanivpaz/yanivpaz.github.io/blob/master/_posts/markdowns/eks-deployment-methods.md). 
dont forget to deploy the relevant addons from [this list](https://github.com/yanivpaz/yanivpaz.github.io/blob/master/_posts/markdowns/eks-posts-deployment.md) .

I hope that AWS will provide simple method to deploy all those addons using one of the popular tools to deploy multiple helm charts ( like [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) ,[reckoner](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/reckoner) ,[helmsman](https://github.com/Praqma/helmsman) )

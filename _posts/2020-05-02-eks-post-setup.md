# K8s resources you might need after EKS deployment
so you managed to install EKS control plane and worked nodes in your favourite method. 
dont forget to deploy the relevant addons from [this list](https://github.com/yanivpaz/yanivpaz.github.io/blob/master/_posts/markdowns/eks-posts-deployment.md) .

I really hope that AWS will provide simple method to deploy all those using one of the popular tools to deploy multiple charts ( like [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) ,[reckoner](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/reckoner) ,[helmsman](https://github.com/Praqma/helmsman) )

# EKS - IP definitions 

The definition of IP ranges for EKS clusters can be confusing : pods , nodes and services.  
Where are they getting their IPs from ?

## EKS pods and nodes IP 
### Option 1 - VPC CIDR 
Use the default VPC CIDR 

### Option 2 - secondary CIDR  
It is possible to define additional different CIDR por the nodes and pods.  

The CIDR should be using RFC1918 range :
```
10.0.0.0/8 
172.16.0.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16   
```
[See the instructions here](https://www.eksworkshop.com/beginner/160_advanced-networking/secondary_cidr/) 

Additional ip ranges are [also supported](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/10/amazon-eks-now-supports-additional-vpc-cidr-blocks/)  
The CIDR range are below:
```
100.64.0.0/10 
198.19.0.0/16	
```
100.64.0.0/10  is part of [shared IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_shared_address_space) 

## EKS services IP
### Option 1
The range is set by AWS during EKS deploymnet , depanding on subnet range  . 
This is actually subset of RFC1918 CIDR range:
```
10.100.0.0/16 
172.20.0.0/16
```

### Option 2 
It is possible to [define custom service cluster ip](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/10/amazon-eks-supports-configurable-kubernetes-service-ip-address-range/) .

Examples:
- [Cloudformation ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-eks-cluster-kubernetesnetworkconfig.html)
- [Terraform](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks/issues/1056) ) 
In this case the RFC1918 CIDR range should be used :
```
10.0.0.0/8 
172.16.0.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16   
```

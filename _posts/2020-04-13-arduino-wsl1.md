# Using pyfirmata in  WSL
There alot of information in the web how to run your first arduino projects,  
but most of them cover Arduino IDE or native windows (i.e COM serial commection name).  

The link below provides checklist for running those projects in WSL .  
As example , I used [pyfirmata](https://pypi.org/project/pyFirmata2/) to turn on light.

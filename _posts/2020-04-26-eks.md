AWS EKS is not simple to install and maintain . 
There are many tools to install ( cloudformation, eksctl , AWS CDK , Terraform ) ,  
many pods to deploy after  ( alb , external dns , node drainer) 
many integrations to other AWS services ( OIDC, VPC, Cloudwatch , Elastic ) 


I will try to go over the challanges in the futures ,  
for now [Here are my EKS bookmarks](https://github.com/yanivpaz/awesome-eks/blob/master/README.md)

AWS EKS is not simple to install and maintain.   
*  how you should install ( cloudformation, eksctl , AWS CDK , Terraform ) ,  
*  which pods are needed  to deploy after the deployments ( alb , external dns , node drainer etc) 
*  what are the integrations to other AWS services ( OIDC, Cloudwatch , Elastic , VPC ) 
*  how you should upgrade - blue greeen ? rolling upgrade ? redblack ?


I will try to go over these challanges in the futures ,  
for now, lets start with [my EKS bookmarks](https://github.com/yanivpaz/awesome-eks/blob/master/README.md)

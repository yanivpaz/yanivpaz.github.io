AWS EKS is not simple to install and maintain.   
*  many tools to install ( cloudformation, eksctl , AWS CDK , Terraform ) ,  
*  many pods to deploy after the deployments ( alb , external dns , node drainer) 
*  many integrations to other AWS services ( OIDC, Cloudwatch , Elastic , VPC ) 


I will try to go over these challanges in the futures ,  
for now, lets start with [ my EKS bookmarks](https://github.com/yanivpaz/awesome-eks/blob/master/README.md)

AWS EKS is not simple to install and maintain.   
*  what is the best way to install ( cloudformation, eksctl , AWS CDK , Terraform or maybe using Cluster API ?) 
*  which infrastructure applications are needed  on top of eks ? ( alb , external dns , node drainer etc) 
*  what are the integrations to other AWS services ? ( OIDC , cloudwatch , elasticseatch etc ) 
*  how you should upgrade - blue greeen ? rolling upgrade ? or maybe red black ?

I will try to address these questions in the future .
for now, lets start with [my EKS bookmarks](https://github.com/yanivpaz/awesome-eks/blob/master/README.md)

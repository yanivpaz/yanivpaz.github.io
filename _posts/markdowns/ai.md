## AWS services
* Amazon Transcribe is an AWS service that makes it easy for customers to convert speech-to-text. Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech.
* Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech.
* AWS Lex -  convert speech-to-text and recognize the customers' intentions.
* Personalize 
* Textract
* AWS Comperhend
  * Group articles by topics using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
* Rekognition
   * find objects, people, text, or scenes in images and videos. What AWS service should you
   * find logo in social media
   * content moderation 
* Kendra - document search service
* Mechanical tork - distributed virtual workforce
  * for example: image classification
* AWS augmented AI
  * prediction checks by humans or machines 
* Amazon transcribe for medical
  * HIPAA compliant
  * Transcribe medical - audio to text (physician)
  * Amazon Comprehend medical - text to summary (analyzed text)
    * Transcribe to Amazon Comprehend  (kids )
  * Amazon hardware for AI
    * AWS Trainium - ML chip for deep learning
    * AWS Inferntia - ML chip for inference 

* Content moderation 
  - AWS Rekognition is best for automated, scalable, and cost-effective content moderation with machine learning.
  - AWS Mechanical Turk is ideal for tasks requiring human judgment and nuanced understanding.


 * Sagemaker
   * extract -  supervised, unsupervised
   * AMT automatically chooses hyperparameter ranges, search strategy, maximum runtime of a tuning job, and early stop condition
   * Real time vs asynchronous vs  batch vs serverless ( only RAM selection,OOB ASG , more latency)
   * Data wrangler - Prepare tabular and image data for machine learning (sql support and data quality tool)
      * use for transform 
   * ML features -Features are inputs to ML models used during training and used for inference (ie - data to birthday)
   * Sagemaker clarify
       *  evaluate model vs modelB
       *  model explainability
       *  Ability to detect and
       *  explain biases in your datasets and models (ie - more men than women)
    * SageMaker Ground truth - Reinforcement learning from human feedback
       * • Reinforcement learning where human feedback is included in the “reward” function
    * SageModel cards - Essential model information

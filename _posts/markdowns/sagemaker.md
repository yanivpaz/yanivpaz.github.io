 * Sagemaker
   * extract -  supervised, unsupervised
   * AMT automatically chooses hyperparameter ranges, search strategy, maximum runtime of a tuning job, and early stop condition
   * Real time vs asynchronous vs  batch vs serverless ( only RAM selection,OOB ASG , more latency)
   * Data wrangler - Prepare tabular and image data for machine learning (sql support and data quality tool)
      * use for transform 
   * ML features -Features are inputs to ML models used during training and used for inference (ie - data to birthday)
   * Sagemaker clarify
       *  evaluate model vs modelB
       *  model explainability
       *  Ability to detect and
       *  explain biases in your datasets and models (ie - more men than women)
    * SageMaker Ground truth - Reinforcement learning from human feedback
       * • Reinforcement learning where human feedback is included in the “reward” function
    * SageMaker model registry
    * SageMaker pipelines - build train and deploy models (like CD) - process, train,tune, AutoML  , Model, ClarityCheck,QualityCheck
    * SageModel cards - Essential model information
    * SageMaker canvas
      * no coding
      * ready to use models with integration to other AWS sercices 
    * SageMaker
       * Hub - browse , experiment  customize and deploy 
       * Pre made solution - HL solution -browse ,  customize and deploy 
    * MLFlows
       * open source integrated with SageMaker
       * part of SageMaker studio
